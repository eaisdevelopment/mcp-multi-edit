Implement the MCP Multi-Edit server following the CLAUDE.md instructions. Start with TDD - write tests first, then implement. Begin with completing the applyEdits function in src/core/editor.ts.

  The project has:
  - Type definitions ready
  - Validation schemas with Zod
  - Basic utility functions implemented
  - Test stubs for TDD
  - Tool schemas defined

  The new Claude Code session just needs to implement the core applyEdits logic and wire it up.
